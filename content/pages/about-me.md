Slug: about-me

My name is Denis Sergeev and I am doing a PhD in Meteorology at the University of East Anglia, UK. My research aims at understanding the dynamics of polar mesoscale cyclones, as well as their representation in modern numerical weather prediction systems.

### Areas of Interest
* Polar low dynamics
* Mesoscale meteorology
* Atmospheric energetics
* Atmospheric boundary layer
* Extraterrestrial meteorology
